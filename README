Additional measures may be necessary to ensure the authenticity of your transaction and your payment information.

Unless otherwise stated at the time a Gift Card is purchased, the Gift Card price does not include sales taxes, which may be charged to you separately by the Merchant at the time the Gift Card is redeemed.

All aspects regarding the use and redemption of Gift Cards are subject to the applicable Merchant’s policies (see Gift Card section below). To use the Platform Service, a User must create an account with eGifter and may have the option to create a password to access the account. To purchase or contribute to the purchase of a Gift Card, a User will choose a Recipient, choose a purchase amount or enter a contribution amount toward a Group Gift, optionally personalize the gift, complete the purchase process and in the case of a Group Gift, invite others to contribute to the value of the Gift Card.

You should not authorize any other person or entity to use your unique User ID. You are responsible for preventing such unauthorized use. You are solely responsible for any and all access to the Site and your use of the Platform Services. If you become aware of any unauthorized activity, you agree to notify us immediately.

Although the Platform Service may enable you to purchase or contribute to the purchase of a Gift Card, the only transaction that you will have with eGifter is for your payment toward the Gift Card and fees charged (if any) for using the Platform Service. We do not have any control over the intended Recipient, or any other Users of the Platform Service, nor do we have any control over the Merchant.

The dealings between you, and any Users or the Merchant are solely between you and the applicable User or Merchant, as the case may be. We are not responsible for changes in any Merchant’s Gift Card terms and conditions; including any price change that may occur after you purchase or contribute to a Gift Card, but prior to redemption for the applicable product or service.

The Merchant has the liability for the redemption of the Gift Card for goods or services. We have no obligation to resolve any dispute between you and any other User or Merchant. Users may resolve a dispute directly with each other or with Merchant. If you have or participate in any dispute or its resolution, you expressly agree to indemnify and hold harmless eGifter and its officers, employees, members, managers, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, representatives, and successors ("Indemnified Parties") from and against all third-party claims, costs, losses, liabilities and expenses (including damage awards, settlement amounts, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, whether incurred as the result of a third-party claim or a claim to enforce this Term), and other damages of any kind, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, liquidated or otherwise (collectively, "Losses") related to such dispute.

Gift Cards

As set forth above, Gift Cards are issued by the applicable Merchant, which shall be fully responsible for any and all claims or liabilities related to the Gift Cards, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed or partially redeemed Gift Cards. By purchasing a Gift Card from eGifter, the Recipient acquires the right to redeem the Gift Card issued by the Merchant, and to use the Gift Card subject to the Terms and by the Merchant's terms and conditions.

All risk of loss and title for the Gift Card will pass to the Recipient upon electronic transmission or physical shipment, as applicable of the Gift Card to such Recipient. eGifter is not responsible if a Gift Card is lost, stolen, destroyed, or used without permission. eGifter is not responsible if any Gift Card is rendered unsuitable for redemption through no fault of eGifter. If your Gift Card order is incorrect, the User or Recipient must notify eGifter within 30 days and, provided the balance on the Gift Card has not been spent and has not changed from the original amount, we will use our best commercially reasonable efforts to correct the error. If eGifter is not notified of any error within 30 days of the date of electronic transmission or shipment of the Gift Card, the Gift Card will be deemed to be satisfactory. Some Gift Cards may not be redeemable outside the US. It is your responsibility to confirm if a Merchant's card can be redeemed internationally.

No single User may purchase more than $2,000 on any single Gift Card on any single day and no User may buy or send Gift Cards in an amount of $10,000 or more in any single day in one or more transactions. If you purchase more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) of Gift Cards in a calendar year, eGifter, in its reasonable sole discretion, may determine You are subject to the eGifter Bulk Order Terms of Use. You can review these terms at https://www.egifter.com/bulk/terms/.

eGifter Choice Card™ Terms

If you want to buy a gift card, but are unsure about the particular merchant, eGifter allows you to purchase an eGifter Choice Card™, which is a private label closed loop gift card, which may only be applied towards the purchase of eligible Merchant Gift Cards available at the time of redemption at the eGifter website. Upon purchase, or contribution in the case of a Group Gift of a Gift Card, the funds are applied to an eGifter Choice Card until such time that the Merchant Gift Card is claimed by the Recipient or the User that initiated the Group Gift, as applicable. In the case of a Group Gift, once a gift card is claimed, no additional contributions can be made. The purchases of a Merchant Gift Card will be deducted from the eGifter Choice Card balance. Any unused balance will remain on the applicable eGifter Choice Card. If an order exceeds the amount of the eGifter Choice Card, the balance must be paid with a credit card or other available payment method. To view eGifter Choice Card balances, login to eGifter and view "My Balance".

The risk of loss and title for eGifter Choice Cards pass to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the Purchaser or Recipient, whichever is applicable.

Available denominations of the Merchant Gift Cards and locations of the Merchants are also subject to change. eGifter Choice Cards are not redeemable for cash, may not be returned, credited or exchanged, and may not be used on the website or in the stores of any of the Merchants displayed on the site.

LAWS OF CERTAIN GOVERNING JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES.

Claiming a Gift Card

Digital Gift Cards require the Recipient to click a "Claim" button or link on the Platform Service or electronic delivery notification and may require the Recipient to login to the Platform Service. Upon purchase, or Contribution in the case of a Group Gift, the funds are applied to an eGifter Choice Card until such time the Merchant Gift Card is Claimed by the Purchaser or Recipient. In the case of a Group Gift, once a Gift Card is claimed, no additional contributions can be made.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under these Terms, if after thirty-six (36) months of inactivity of an eGifter Choice Card, or if it has not been redeemed toward the purchase of eligible Merchant Gift Card during this period of time, then anytime thereafter, eGifter may apply dormancy fees to the eGifter Choice Card in accordance with applicable laws, or automatically redeem such eGifter Choice Card for a Merchant Gift Card selected by eGifter at eGifter's sole discretion, and send the eGifter selected Merchant Gift Card to the Purchaser or Recipient email address, SMS number or mailing address on file.
